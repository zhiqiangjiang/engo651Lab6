In this assignment, we can sketch out a polyline on the map interface by engaging with the "Line Drawing" button situated in the upper left-hand area. Upon completion of their polyline drawing, they may opt to streamline it using the "Simplify" option presented within the application's front end, thereby offering a more comprehensible rendition of the drawn path or region. To clear the existing polyline from the map canvas and initiate a fresh design, one merely needs to tap the "Remove" button. The system empowers users with the liberty to revise their polylines repeatedly and without restriction, allowing them to create multiple polylines as desired and delete them whenever needed.
